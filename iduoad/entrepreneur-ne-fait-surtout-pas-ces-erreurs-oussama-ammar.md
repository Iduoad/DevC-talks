- Mariage entrepreneur/boite(secteur) est un facteur cle pour la reussite des startups
- Les bons entrepreneurs arrivent a creer leur propre caricature = incarnation de projet par l'entrepreneur.
- No one can succeed in many sectors. to succeed in an industry you have to be compatible with it, you either need to change the industry or change your personality.
- Serial entrepreneurs are a myth, entrepreneurs that are successful in many industries are just replicating what they are good at in many industries (they are always succeeding in what they are good at) e.g. is Elon Musk who is succeeding in selling the dream in the industries he's in.
- You need to know yourself, before building your own startup.
- 8:50, Startuper looking for a developer to develop his idea. Developers work for who will provide them value(corporate) they don't to work on other's ideas. They will work with you if you provide something they won't find elsewhere (personality, competence, experience ...).
- You need to live (learn, and accumulate experience) before starting your startup, or you'll be forced to learn starting your startup. Entrepreneurship is not theoretical.
- Never delegate a task you don't know how to do. Learn how to do it first then look for someone to delegate it to. This will help you judge your recruitees abilities.
- You should consider entrepreneurship as a career, and thrive to get better from one experience to another. Consider every startup as a line of a CV.(Strategy)
- The odds to be the next Mark Zuckerberg are very low. You shouldn't be biased by such experiences, and try to focus on a project.
- Having an great Idea for your first startup is not mandatory. First experiences are meant to be lessons.
- Product-Market-Fit is evident. It is where you are overwhelmed by the clients reaction to your product. In this phase you are never up to the market expectations, and you are disappointing the most people (clients).
- When you don't have the PMF, you need to change what you are doing.
- 22:00 Example Pressing: Pricing and scale, and fitting the Market.
- Intensity is key in product validation (it reveals the truth), e.g if you reduce the price of your product by 90% and no one is willing to buy it, then it is not a pricing problem.
- Targeting and Segmentation is important in validation. (The message)
- Deleting features can help too in market validation.
- Key entrepreneur :
    - Surroundings: being surrounded by positive people is so important.
    - Don't lie to yourself and to people (intern) about your weaknesses. Speak up !!!
    - Find people smarter than you and ask for help.
- Sharing your problems with the employees, will make them as responsible. Because if you end up by not solving your problem later, you have another problem: not sharing the problem.
    - Extern: Clients, Partners, suppliers ...
    - Intern: Employees, investors ...
- Having fun should be the thermometer of entrepreneurs.
- You should prepare to the entrepreurial experience:
    - No debts
    - No complicated personal relationships ...
- Enjoy the Experience !! Have fun !!
