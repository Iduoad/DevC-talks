- Gary Marcus opening position: Neural nets's "classic connectionism couldn't learn universals outside training space". Nontheless, deep learning should be abandoned, but that that it should be "re-contextualized as a tool among many".
- Yoshua Benjio opening statment: the main challenge is how to generalize beyond training data. Deep learning, is "not a particular architecture or a particular training procedure...It's something that's moving, it's more a philosophy as we add more principles to our toolbox".
- Both Agree that AI systems need a hybrid approach; that some kinds of priors knowledge are needed.
- On hybrid systems, Bengio stated he's not interested if hybrids are "about GOFAI [good old fashioned AI] algorithms, like rules and logic, which have a lot of value as inspiration, but trying to take them and glue them to neural nets doesn't work."
- AI is very far from obtaining consciousness; "Philosophers ask should we eventually give person-hood to machines ...I don't think we are anywhere close to understanding this question enough to give answers." -B
- Ethical considirations are just as importnat, "at least as important [â€¦] is the question of how we deploy these things, which is the responsibility of everyone in the chain." -B, one way to answer that is through common sense "my own version is that common sense could be a way to build a framework that would allow machines to represent values; we want robots to not do harm to people." -M.
