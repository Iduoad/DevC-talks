- AI & ML have been used and applied long before the hype and buzzwords were coined.
- Doing AI on the ground faces challenges that are different form doing AI for research proposes:
  - Setting the wrong metric for AI project value: what is the real ROI for AI teams?
  - Miscommunications around the actual problem to solve: Business VS Data Science points of view, affecting the problem to solve and the parameters to start with.
  - Business validation: (especially critical in financial services) This is different form AI validation, questioning the model assumptions, the explainability, the data privacy, the risks of deployment, ...
- Most of these obstacles aren't technical, they are organizational. And so are the possible solutions:
  - Cultivating AI awareness on the executive side of the project (recognizing a ML problem, recognizing what a Data scientist cannot do, ...)
  - Using Multidisciplinary teams: blending pure ML engineers with others types of profiles
  - Incorporate Design Thinking into the Delivery Model: minimizing the roadblocks of delivery via Forward Design.
