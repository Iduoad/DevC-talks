- **SSH Keys** : a more secure alternative to password-based logins, used to administer and communicate with servers
- **Firewalls** : controls what services are exposed to the network, blocking or allowing them. Those services categorized into public, private and internal services
- **VPC Networks** : abbreviation of Virtual Private Cloud, those are private networks for your infrastructureâ€™s resources ensuring more secure connection among resources
- **Service Auditing** : process of discovering and analyzing what services are running on the servers and lock down the components to avoid attacks
- **Unattended Updates** : maintaining updates on a server is a must and they can prevent vulnerabilities. Unattended updates allow the system to update a majority of packages automatically.
- **Disable Directory Indexes** : most web servers are configured by default to display directory indexes when a user accesses a directory that lacks an index file. So disabling them can prevent you from malicious attacks
- **Back Up Frequently** : you should back up your systems and data regularly
