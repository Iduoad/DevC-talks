- DRY principle (Don’t repeat yourself) : divide your code into **small reusable units** and then use them whenever you want.
- Your job **isn't** done once your code works as intended, you must **refactor** it. Refactoring will improve readability of your code and make it easier to maintain. (Most of the time, a clean version of your code is available).
- **Business first**, then tech comes after. _Some developers don’t care about the business or the economic factors that justify their job’s existence_.
- Get use to exercise **small commits** on your code and **writing a descriptive commits messages**, to find quickly what caused a bug when it occures and make the life easy for the reviewer.
- **Be consistent** when writing your code, pick your style guide and apply it.
- Work on a piece of code from zero till it’s completely finished. **Finished** means : your code is refactored, tested and documented.
- **Never stop learning**, new technologies emerge daily. _Once you stop learning, you will stop growing_.
