- Performance is a big problem:50% of sites shifts over 1MB of Javascript
- performance shouldn't be related to only some users conditions
- Performance is an after thought:we all start thinking about it after we start having issues.
- Solutions:better defaults(make tools and frameworks better)
- better guard rails 
- make the best of a tool
