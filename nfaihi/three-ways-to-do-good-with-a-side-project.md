- Possibility of applying what worked in your side projects in your daily job, and maybe it will become your day job
- By side projects you can achieve a splendid success (Slack, Twitter and Docker were essentially side projects)
- The use of side projects to donate code and mentorship to good causes. To do so, here are some ways and paths where you can find projects in need of your skills :
    - **The United Nations** provides a volunteers program called [UN Volunteers program](https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en) that match online volunteers with projects around the globe for good purposes
    - [**Social Coder**](https://socialcoder.org) works on connecting developers with charities who have specific projects. It plays the role of an intermediary between charities and developers
    - **COVID-19** : [Code Against COVID-19](https://www.codementor.io/covid19/projects) is a way to help specifically with the current COVID-19 situation. Aims to connect developers with programs combating the virus.
